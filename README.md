# Shuttle 2

A JavaScript server side modding environment for people of all coding experiences, thought
primarily targeted at being accessible for those with little coding experience.

### A note on Workspace Environments

Shuttle 2 is built to work in an obfuscated environment, and, due to
development limitations, a deobfuscated Mojmap environment.
(I am considering using our own mapping set, however, which prefixes mojang names with mc_, so no method clashes in dev).

Therefore, do not be alarmed if it does not run in a yarn development environment due to
shuttle methods clashing with yarn named methods.
